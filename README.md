# schoology-stylemod-v2
literally so much better if you're using v1 then go kys (in minecraft of course)

# to install
step 1: have tampermonkey installed. if you don't want to install tampermonkey then idk go fuck youself with a broom handle or something <br>
get tampermonkey [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) <br>
step 2: click [this link](https://github.com/bean-frog/schoology-stylemod-v2/raw/main/src/main.user.js) to automatically install as long as you have tampermonkey. if you dont want to click it you can go to src/main.user.js and clic the little button that says raw, it does the exact same shit

# features or some shit idk i was told i should add this part
  - Windows 10 style draggable menu window, planning to add linux/mac styles but probably not go fuck yourself <br>
  - change background
  - change content opacity
  - Somewhat robust color customization, current things you can change the color of are:

# features that are going to be added but im lazy so dont count on it
  - block posts from a certain user
  - change border color
  - change text color
