literally so much better if you're using v1 then go kys (in minecraft of course)

# to install
step 1: have tampermonkey installed. if you don't want to install tampermonkey then idk go fuck youself with a broom handle or something <br>
get tampermonkey [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) <br>
step 2: click this handy link to automatically install as long as you have tampermonkey. if you dont want to click it you can go to src/main.user.js and clic the little button that says raw, it does the exact same shit
