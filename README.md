# schoology-stylemod-v2
literally so much better if you're using v1 then go kys (in minecraft of course)

# install as userscript
step 1: have tampermonkey installed. if you don't want to install tampermonkey then use the extension thing below <br>
get tampermonkey [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) <br>
step 2: click [this link](https://github.com/bean-frog/schoology-stylemod-v2/raw/main/src/main-obf.user.js) to automatically install as long as you have tampermonkey. if you dont want to click it you can go to src/main.user.js and clic the little button that says raw, it does the exact same shit

# install as extensiion
step 1: go to the [latest release](https://github.com/bean-frog/schoology-stylemod-v2/releases/latest) <br>
step 2: download schoology-mod.crx <br>
step 3: go to your browser's extension panel (usually browser-name://extensions, for example: brave://extensions) <br>
step 4: drag and drop schoology-mod.crx to that menu and it will open a window to confirm <br>
step 5: go to schoology and reload
  (actual extension on the Chrome Web Store will come at some point when this mod is actually good)
